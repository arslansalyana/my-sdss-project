# School Site Selection Using AHP and Raster Data
ðŸš€ GeoSuitability Analyzer: A web application for school site selection using GIS and remote sensing. Evaluate potential locations based on criteria such as proximity to other schools, hospitals, roads, and transportation. Utilizes Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) for decision-making.

This project demonstrates the use of the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and raster data analysis for identifying suitable locations for school sites.

## Key Features

Criteria Identification and Weighting using AHP
Raster Data Processing and Normalization
Weighted Overlay Analysis to Combine Criteria
Suitability Classification
Visualization of Suitability Map

## Dependencies

Python 3.x
NumPy
Rasterio
GeoPandas
Matplotlib

## Input Data

Raster datasets representing:
Schools
Hospitals
Roads
Transportation

## Output

A classified suitability map with suitability classes ranging from 1 (most suitable) to 10 (least suitable).
