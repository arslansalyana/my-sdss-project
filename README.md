# School Site Selection Using AHP and Raster Data
ðŸš€ GeoSuitability Analyzer: A web application for school site selection using GIS and remote sensing. Evaluate potential locations based on criteria such as proximity to other schools, hospitals, roads, and transportation. Utilizes Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) for decision-making.

This project demonstrates the use of the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and raster data analysis for identifying suitable locations for school sites.

## Key Features

1. Criteria Identification and Weighting using AHP
2. Raster Data Processing and Normalization
3. Weighted Overlay Analysis to Combine Criteria
4. Suitability Classification
5. Visualization of Suitability Map

## Dependencies

1. Python 3.x
2. NumPy
3. Rasterio
4. GeoPandas
5. Matplotlib

## Input Data

A. Criteria and their weights

B. Raster datasets representing:
1. Schools
2. Hospitals
3. Roads
4. Transportation

## Output

A classified suitability map with suitability classes ranging from 1 (most suitable) to 10 (least suitable).
